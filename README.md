# Forest-Coverage-and-Temperature
I wanted some exercise to learn about covariance and correlation. I randomly chose a topic and analysed the data.

The sources of the data:
Land Coverage Data: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL
Temperature Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palinatx/mean-temperature-for-countries-by-year-2014-2022?resource=download
